# Getting-GeoLocation
Find your accurate geolocation using selenium and Python. 

Most of the solutions found on the internet involves finding your geolocation based on your IP Address. Those solutions give you the geolocation of the server rather than that of your present location. 

Use getlocation.py along with the suitable chromedriver for your chrome version to find the location based on your current location.
If you are using Chrome version 71, the above chromedriver.exe will work. Otherwise, kindly download the suitable chrome driver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

PS:  Make sure that getlocation.py and the chromedriver.exe are located in the same directory. chromedriver.exe is not to be executed but just stored in the same directory as your python file.
